This project is designed to recognize and assign labels (classes) to images based on their visual characteristics using advanced machine learning techniques. 
The application leverages two prominent machine learning models:

Support Vector Machines (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

Features:
Image Recognition: Accurately classifies images into predefined categories based on their visual features.
Multiple ML Models: Utilizes SVM and k-NN algorithms for robust and versatile image classification.
Web Interface: Displays the classification results on an interactive webpage built with Flask.
User-Friendly: Easy-to-use interface for uploading images and viewing results.
